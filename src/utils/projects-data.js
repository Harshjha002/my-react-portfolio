        largeDesc: "I developed an online food delivery app using React, Redux, React-Router, and Tailwind CSS. This app offers a seamless and responsive user experience, allowing users to browse through a wide selection of restaurants, view detailed menus, and place orders effortlessly. React was used to create a dynamic and interactive user interface, while Redux efficiently manages the state across different components, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience. React-Router enables efficient navigation between pages, providing users with a hassle-free way to explore various sections of the app. The applicationâ€™s design is sleek and modern, thanks to Tailwind CSS, which helped in styling the components with precision, ensuring a visually appealing interface. The app is optimized for both mobile and desktop users, making it accessible and easy to use on any device. Overall, this project showcases my ability to build a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing web application from scratch",
